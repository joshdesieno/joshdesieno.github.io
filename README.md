Homework #1 - Comp20

1. I believe that I have successfully implemented all aspects of the  
   assignment. (However, I have put the image of myself in the bio page 
   instead of the index simply out of preference)

2. Noah Hill, a fellow comp20 student, helped me to understand how to make it
   so my index.html page was hosted by my Tufts CS account.

3. I've spent approximately 5 hours on this homework.
